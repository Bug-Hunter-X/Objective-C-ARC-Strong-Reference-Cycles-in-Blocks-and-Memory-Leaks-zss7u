In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, strong reference cycles can easily occur within blocks. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)doSomething {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        self.myString = @"Hello";
        NSLog(@"String set in background: %@
", self.myString);
    });
}
@end
```

If MyClass has a strong reference to `self`, and the block within `doSomething` also strongly captures `self` (implicitly or explicitly), a strong reference cycle occurs: MyClass strongly holds the block, and the block strongly holds MyClass. Even after `doSomething` completes, neither object will be deallocated. This leads to memory leaks.

Another issue often encountered is incorrect usage of `copy` and `strong` properties for blocks passed to methods or set as properties. Using `strong` may lead to strong reference cycles if the block captures `self`.  Using `copy` creates a copy of the block, but this can still retain the objects it captures.
